# Grover search on a database using Qiskit
This exercise demonstrates Grover's search algorithm on a simple database.

The file The_genius_of_Grover's_Algorithm.pdf discusses how Grover developed the optimal search algorithm.

The Jupyter Notebook Grover_Search_on_a_Database.ipynb discusses the code that demonstrates how a simple classical database can be encoded as a quantum oracle to perform search.
This is essentially to demystify the concept of an oracle often described as a "magic" black-box that "cheats" by selectively reflecting the target state to be searched.

This implementation demonstates the true meaning of an oracle query in the context of database access.
